This code reads a file containing experimental data on 210Pb_exc in sediment core layers.
You must specify the name and path of the file. It also reads a file from the 'aleat/' folder
with the same number of entries.

Required input parameters:
- An initial estimate of the mean value and relative deviation for activity concentrations and SARs.
- Definition of scanning intervals around these values to generate solvers.
- The number NR of divisions per interval. By default, the same NR is used for all four parameters,
  resulting in NR**4 solvers.
- Optional: time-mark information to define an objective function.

The code defines a sorting function to find the best arrangement of (A0i, wi) pairs for each solver.
This means the sorting that minimizes the quadratic distance to the experimental profile.

The adjusted chi-value (X_gl) is computed for the best sorting of each solver.

Outputs:
- `Mapa4D.txt`: contains the four input values and corresponding X_gl for each solver.
- `Absolute_min.txt`: contains the absolute minimum found across all solvers.

These outputs can be used by other scripts for plotting and further analysis.

The parts of the code that need your action are bounded by lines ++++++++++++++

# 0.1 - 0.3, depending on how "noisy" the experimental profile is. 
# For complex cases requiring values higher than 0.3 -0.4 better to use log_normal distributions
# (read more in publications).

# It is recommened running this code at least twice. In the first run you can
